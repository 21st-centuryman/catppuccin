	Creating Catppuccin ports
</p>

&nbsp;

This section covers how to properly create Catppuccin ports and how to submit them!

### What's a port?

A port is basically an adaptation of Catppuccin's palettes for an app to use. Think of it as a colorscheme for a program that styles every UI component it consists of!

### Creation

You can create ports using [this](https://github.com/catppuccin/template) public template as a blueprint. However, you must **not** create it the traditional way (by clicking **Use this template**), because this leaves a _small_ tag under the repos' name that says `generated from <template>`. To avoid this, follow the instructions below:

1. Create the repo and leave it empty
2. Add this template as a remote: `git remote add template git@github.com:catppuccin/template.git`
3. Pull from it: `git pull template main --depth=1`
4. Delete the remote: `git remote remove template`

### Styling!

Although you just created the repo successfully, it's important to style properly to ensure consistency:

-   The name of the repo must be the simplest version of the app's name (e.g `nvim` instead of `NeoVim`)
-   Put the images under `assets/`. If there are a bunch of them consider [creating an empty branch](https://gist.github.com/joncardasis/e6494afd538a400722545163eb2e1fa5) (e.g. `assets`) and storing them there.
-   Format the repo's description as "`<allusive emoji>` "Soothing pastel theme for App"
-   Add `catppuccin` to the topics.
-   Ensure uppercase meta files (e.g. `README.md`)
-   Don't add health files (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCTS.md`, `SUPPORT.md`), those are organization-wide files stored [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/.github).

#### Submission

Open an issue under the main repo and fill out the information requested on the "[port request](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=port+request&template=port-request.md&title=App)". It's recommended to also share the port in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/r6Mdz5dpFc) beforehand so that other members of the community can give their opinion on it and hopefully improve it.
